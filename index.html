        <p>
            Currently, I am working to support students in College Point as a secretary. At night, I work with programs that include SPSS, R and excel to explore statistical relationships between variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my research, I'm focused on calendar events(holidays, weather days, etc) and their relationship to attendance rates before and after they occur.
